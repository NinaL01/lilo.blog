Fountains play a crucial role in fulfilling our basic need of fresh water. Additionally, they enhance public spaces and preserve cultural heritage. An example of this is the city of Bern where there are about 217 fresh water fountains dating back to the 16th century (Bern, N/D). The goal of every city should be to make fresh water for everyone; however accessibility for pets, such as dogs, remains an issue. Making these fountains dog-friendly would support animal care, encourage responsible pet ownership, and make the city more inclusive. The map above displays the locations of fountains in Bern, categorized by their accessibility to dogs. Red markers represent fountains that are not dog- accessible, while blue markers indicate fountains that are dog - accessible. The data for this map was collected using “ Survey123” which allows the mapping of factors in an area, then the data was processed and visualized using “ArcGIS”. The data was not complete since the collection was random. Additionally, the buffers indicate a maximum walking distance of 300 meters between fountains, ensuring accessibility
